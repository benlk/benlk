I'm a front- and back-end web dev, working at [10up](https://10up.com/) since 2020. I do backand and Block Editor development on WordPress sites. You've probably seen one of the sites I've worked on.

In my spare time, I tinker with a lot of things, including Jekyll-based personal websites and personal computing projects. I try out things from the wider jounalism coding community. Projects include [an RSS feed of Central Ohio Transit Authority alerts](https://github.com/benlk/cota-reroute-pdf-rss), RSS feeds of [Columbus' government newletters](https://github.com/benlk/columbus-govdelivery-rss) and of [miscellaneous Columbus-area blogs](https://github.com/benlk/columbus-misc-rss), [a list of Columbus domain names](https://github.com/benlk/columbus-gov-websites)

From 2014 to 2020, I was part of the [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org/)' Nerds and Labs teams, where we:

- maintained the [Largo](https://github.com/inn/largo/) parent theme through the Gutenberg transition,
- performed migrations and built themes for WordPress-using news sites, including but not limited to [Workday Minnesota](https://workdayminnesota.org/), [Caribbean Investigative Journalism Network](https://www.cijn.org/), [City Limits](https://citylimits.org/), [Chicago Reporter](https://www.chicagoreporter.com/), [Current](https://www.chicagoreporter.com/), [Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations](https://ipbs.org/), [Mississippi Today](https://mississippitoday.org/), [PublicSource](https://www.publicsource.org/), [San Francisco Public Press](https://sfpublicpress.org/), [Voice of OC](https://voiceofoc.org/), and the [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org/).
