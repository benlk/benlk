I'm a front- and back-end web dev.

From 2014 to 2020, I was part of the [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org/)' Labs team, where we:

- maintained the [Largo](https://github.com/inn/largo/) parent theme
- performed migrations and built themes for WordPress-using news sites
- developed and maintained [many WordPress plugins](https://github.com/INN/docs/tree/master/projects/wordpress-plugins#wordpress-plugins)
- built bespoke interactives and graphics
- consulted on site maintenance
- and provided technical advice to nonprofit newsrooms across the Americas.

In my spare time, I tinker with a lot of things, including Jekyll-based personal websites and personal computing projects.
