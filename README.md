I'm a front- and back-end web dev.

From 2014 to 2020, I was part of the [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org/)' Labs team, where we:

- maintained the [Largo](https://github.com/inn/largo/) parent theme through the Gutenberg transition,
- performed migrations and built themes for WordPress-using news sites, including but not limited to [Workday Minnesota](https://workdayminnesota.org/), [Caribbean Investigative Journalism Network](https://www.cijn.org/), [City Limits](https://citylimits.org/), [Chicago Reporter](https://www.chicagoreporter.com/), [Current](https://www.chicagoreporter.com/), [Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations](https://ipbs.org/), [Mississippi Today](https://mississippitoday.org/), [PublicSource](https://www.publicsource.org/), [San Francisco Public Press](https://sfpublicpress.org/), [Voice of OC](https://voiceofoc.org/), and the [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org/).
- developed and maintained [many WordPress plugins](https://github.com/INN/docs/tree/master/projects/wordpress-plugins#wordpress-plugins), including [Pym.js Embeds](https://github.com/INN/pym-shortcode/), the [Super Cool Ad Inserter Plugin](https://github.com/INN/super-cool-ad-inserter-plugin/), the [Republication Tracker Tool](https://github.com/INN/republication-tracker-tool/issues), and the Trust Project's Trust Indicators plugin (accepted on VIP),
- built bespoke interactives, graphics, and [scrapers](https://github.com/INN/current-ltw-scraper),
- consulted on site maintenance and updates,
- and provided technical advice to nonprofit newsrooms across the Americas.

I take pride in that we were able to continuously provide useful tools and responsive websites with a small team, that our clients were satisfied with our work, and that we wrote good documentation.

In my spare time, I tinker with a lot of things, including Jekyll-based personal websites and personal computing projects. I try out things from the wider jounalism coding community. Personal hobbies include constructing elaborate Halloween costumes and writing short fiction.
